# Chess MVC Example

This repository contains sample code for a simple chess game implemented using
the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. The focus is more to show how a
project might be organized according to MVC rather than building a full-fledged
implementation of chess. Thus none of the functions are implemented, though
comments describe what I would have written if I did implement them.

## Organization

The main source code is found in the `src/` directory.

## Caveats

This repository is missing crucial portions of a full-fledged project: unit
tests, installation code and instructions, and an implementation. Again, **this
is an example**.
